            values of the units relate to. For example:
            {-1: 'Cold', 0: 'Neutral', +1: 'Hot'}
            {0: 'False', 1: 'True'}
        *   point_in_time: Boolean to note whether the data type represents conditions
            at a single instant in time (True) as opposed to being an average or
            accumulation over time (False) when it is found in hourly lists of data.
            (True Examples: Temperature, WindSpeed)
            (False Examples: Energy, Radiation, Illuminance)
        *   cumulative: Boolean to tell whether the data type can be cumulative when it
            is represented over time (True) or it can only be averaged over time
            to be meaningful (False). Note that cumulative cannot be True
            when point_in_time is also True.
            (False Examples: Temperature, Irradiance, Illuminance)
            (True Examples: Energy, Radiation)
